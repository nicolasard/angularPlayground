## Angular2 playground
This is my playground for angular2, i try to follow the Angular official [quickstart](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart)

To start the configuration you need first to configurate the setenv.bat then install the Angular CLI
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Remember that to run any project first we need to install locally the dependencies with the following command.

```
cd demo1
npm install 
```

To test the app during the development run 
```
cd demo1
ng serve 
```

To build the aplication to distribute it 
```
cd demo1
ng build 
```
